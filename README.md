This is my [personal website](https://noahlaf.me). I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to build the website, and I host it on [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/). I use this Git repo as a [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) and created a CD pipeline with GitHub and Amplify to ensure the website is always up to date
