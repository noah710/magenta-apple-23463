## Overview

I first got involved Pitt RAS when I showed up for my first meeting at the end of the 2019 Spring semester. Soon after, the club became my second home as I made lots of new friends with similar interests as me.

### Technical Experience

During the first 3 months over the Summer, I led a small and tight-knit team of 3 students on the project. Unlike most of my friends, I did not have an internship that Summer, so I treated the club as my internship and learned as much as I could. Since the team was so small, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in our code stack and learn the technical skills I would need to be a good leader. I made most of my **technical contributions** in the Summer, including:

*   Setup robot hardware and electronics
*   Integrated steering and throttle controls with ROS
*   Developed robot localization system
*   Created TensorFlow object detection system

By the end of the Summer, my team and I created a robot that could localize itself and autonomously follow a software-defined path! Check out this milestone on [YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj7x4HNcMWw)

### Soft Experience

With the Fall semester starting, my job as Team Leader changed drastically. Instead of sitting in the workshop hacking with my friends, I was standing in front of hundreds of people recruiting new members and managing relationships with my clubs partnerships. After I had recruited about 15 new members, my job shifted again to organizing and planning our twice-weekly meetings. My time as team leader gave me a unique perspective on not only what it takes to run a team, but how to support your team and the members within it. 



This offered me a great opportunity to work on my **soft skills**, like:
