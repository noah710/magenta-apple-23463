## Overview

I first got involved Pitt RAS when I showed up for my first meeting at the end of the 2019 Spring semster. Soon after, the club became my second home as I made lots of new friends with similar interests as me.

During the first 3 months over the Summer, I led a small and tight-knit team of 3 students on the project. Unlike most of my friends, I did not have an internship that Summer, so I treated the club as my internship and learned as much as I could. Since the team was so small, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in our code stack and learn the technical skills I would need to be a good leader. I made most of my **technical contributions** in the Summer, including:

*   Setup robot hardware and electronics
*   Integrated steering and throttle controls with ROS
*   Developed robot localization system
*   Created TensorFlow object detection system

By the end of the Summer, my team and I had a robot that could localize itself and autonomously follow a software-defined path! We also implemented rudimentary object avoidance, but the videos for that are nothing to write home about.
