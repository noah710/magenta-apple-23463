## Overview

I first got involved Pitt RAS when I showed up for my first meeting at the end of the 2019 Spring semster. I heard they had an autonomous car project and I was eager to get involved. I was concerned that I was not smart enough to make any meaningful contributions to the team, but within a month of joining the team, I was made Team Leader.

During the first 3 months, I led a small and tight-knit team of 3 students on the project. Since the team was so small, I had the opportunity to get down and dirty with our stack and learn the technical skills I would need to be a good leader.
