## Overview

My time at the Robotics Institute started after my [Mentor](https://asaba96.github.io/) arranged for me to meet with some people from Team Explorer to discuss how I could possibly contribute to the project. It was surreal knowing that Team Explorer was just a few blocks away from my campus and I deperately wanted to get involved. I explained that I had robotics experience but that I was interested in working on infrastructure and deployment pipelines, and they acknowledged that their basestation and deployment pipelines could use some TLC.
