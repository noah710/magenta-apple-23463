## Overview

My time at the Robotics Institute started after my [Mentor](https://asaba96.github.io/) arranged for me to meet with some people from Team Explorer to discuss how I could possibly contribute to the project. It was surreal knowing that Team Explorer was just a few blocks away from my campus and I deperately wanted to get involved. I explained that I had robotics experience but that I was interested in working on infrastructure and deployment pipelines. Luckily for me, their basestation and deployment pipelines needed some TLC, and luckily for them, I was offering free labor.

## Contributions

I immeditely got started working under another Software Engineer who was responsible for, among other things, the basestation and deployment pipelines for all the robots. We discussed some problems the team was facing with their Docker infrastructure, particularly with their massive docker-compose configurations and scripts used to deploy particular containers to different robots. I started by fixing bugs in the deployment scripts as I learned my way around the stack.

After about 2 weeks of working on the various docker-compose bugs, I was asked to join another team within the Robotics Institute that desperately needed someone to develop Docker infrastructure for their existing stack. I felt honored that the team needed my skillset and, with the approval of my labs PI, I graciously accepted the offer.
