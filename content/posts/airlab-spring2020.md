## Overview

I was brought on to the MBZIRC team as a Software Engineer Intern shortly after getting my foot in the door at CMU. I worked with a team of CMU graduate students under Dr. Sebastian Scherer and Dr. Oliver Kroemer. After joining the team, I was sponsored to travel to Abu Dhabi to compete at competiton with my team.
