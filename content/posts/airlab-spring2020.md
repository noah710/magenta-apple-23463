## Overview

I was brought on to the MBZIRC team as a Software Engineer Intern shortly after getting my foot in the door at CMU. I worked with a team of CMU graduate students under Dr. Sebastian Scherer and Dr. Oliver Kroemer. After joining the team, I was sponsored to travel to Abu Dhabi to compete with my team.

## Contributions

I was recruited to build out (1) Docker infrastructure for the team's existing codebase, but I took on more responsibility and filled the gaps where needed. (2) I worked closely with each of the 3 subteams to build out deployment pipelines and startup scripts that enabled streamlined development and smooth deployments in competition. While owning my teams infrastructure was my main responsibility, I also volunteered to (3) create our object detection neural networks.

1.  Developed Docker infrastructure for our codebase and deployment pipelines for our drones and ground robots
2.  Identified automatable workflows and automated: deployments, mission launching, error checking & correcting and data collection
3.  Trained YOLOv3 neural networks to detect competition artifacts, and created streamlined process for training on the Airlab's cloud-based cluster computer
