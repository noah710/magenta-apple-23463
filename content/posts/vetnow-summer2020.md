## Overview

VetNOW was my first internship that was not Robotics related. My plans to intern again over the Summer at the CMU Robotics Institute were foiled by Covid-19 :) 

As one of 2 software engineers at this small startup, I wore many hats and took on countless responsibilities. This was around the time when I realized I wanted to be a DevOps Engineer and eventually an SRE, so I tried to learn as much as I could about the platform's infrastructure.
