## Overview

VetNOW was my first internship that was not Robotics related. My plans to intern again over the Summer at the CMU Robotics Institute were foiled by Covid-19 :)

As one of 2 software engineers at this small startup, I wore many hats and took on countless responsibilities. This was around the time when I realized I wanted to be a DevOps Engineer and eventually a Site Reliability Engineer, so I tried to learn as much as I could about the platform's infrastructure. My favorite part of my time here was figuring out and creating a deployment pipeline for our platform. Some of my other responsibilities were:

*   Researched, designed and implemented full stack solutions to integrate bluetooth medical devices (ECG, Camera, SpO2 etc) with the browser-based platform

*   Developed real-time web based graphing utility to visualize ECG and SpO2 output waveforms

*   Developed containerized deployment solution for the platform which enabled rapid local development and testing

*   Worked with Quality Assurance engineers to develop Pytest QA automation system, created CI/CD pipeline and custom tooling to facilitate development and automate operational overhead 

*   Researched Ultrasound devices and acted as Point of Contact with manufacturers and distributors
