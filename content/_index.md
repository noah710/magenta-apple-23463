    content: >
      I'm an experienced Software Engineer with a can-do attitude willing to RTFM and do whatever it takes to keep the ship sailing. I've gained a ton of experience developing in Linux through my various life (2013-present), club (2019-2020) and work (2020-Present) projects. I am a generalist, and my experience helps me learn new technologies and effectively apply them.

      - Robotics
        - 
        - [Software Engineer Intern, CMU Robotics Institute:](/posts/airlab-spring2020/) Supported a team of graduate students developing autonomous drones and ground robots by:
          -  Automating field testing and data collection workflows, decreasing testing time spent in field 3x 
          - Creating deployment pipelines and integrating with Docker infrastructure, decreasing startup time 5x
          - Troubleshooting sensors & owning onboard systems
          - Training various Object Detection NNs for drone intercept challenge (data gathering, cleaning, labeling, validating, training, deploying and optimizing) that achieved 90% effectiveness in competition
        - [Team Leader, Pitt RAS:](/posts/pittras/) Led a team that developed an autonomous ground robot for Pitt RAS, responsible for:
          - Onboard infrastructure
          - Sensor integration
          - Localization & Navigation
          - Cone Detection NN training & deployment
      - Web Programming
        - 
        - Created [StockStack](/projects/stockstack/), a stock and portfolio tracking web app. 
          - HTML/CSS + JavaScript frontend
          - Flask backend with GCP Datastore database
          - Deployed in GCP App Engine 
        - Created [JavaScript Bluetooth](https://www.screencast.com/users/NoahLaFerriere/folders/Default/media/d9540f51-2def-4158-ae16-f8aa3def01ce/embed) module to integrate medical devices with web app
          - JavaScript & Web Bluetooth API to interface with the Bluetooth devices
          - HTML/CSS + JavaScript to display data and waveform from ECG & SpO2 devices
          - NodeJS backend
        - Created [this website](https://github.com/noah710/magenta-apple-23463)
          - A JAMstack website made with Hugo, based on a template from StackBit
          - Deployed on AWS Amplify, with CD pipeline 
      - Test Automation 
        - 
        - Developed, containerized and deployed a [test runner server](https://github.com/noah710/pytest_testrail_testrunner) and integrated it with a 3rd party reporting API
        - Developed, containerized and deployed a [continuous visibility server](https://github.com/noah710/Pytest_Continuous_Visibility), which notified the development team via SMS when critical unit tests failed.
      - Linux Systems & Administration
        - 
        - I'm the "Linux guy" on most teams I work on. I've been developing on Linux systems for 7 years (although only seriously for 3) and I'm excellent at developing, debugging and deploying software in Linux environments. 
        - I am especially experienced with Docker and I have a knack for containerizing and creating deployment solutions for all kinds of software, from SaaS platforms to live field robot stacks.
