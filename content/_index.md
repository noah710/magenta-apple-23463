    content: >
      I'm a CS student and hacker with a can-do attitude willing to RTFM and do
      whatever it takes to keep the ship sailing. I love working on systems
      software and infrastructure and I've gained a ton of experience with Linux
      through my various life, club and work projects. I've spent most of my
      time in positions where my job is to automate workflows, create
      deploy-able environments and "make things work."
