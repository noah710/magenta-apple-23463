    content: >
      I'm a Linux enthusiast with a can-do attitude willing to RTFM and do
      whatever it takes to keep the ship sailing. My strengths and interests are
      primarily focused in systems software and infrastructure but I also enjoy
      computer vision and machine learning applications. I've spent most of my
      time in positions where my job is to automate workflows, create
      deploy-able environments and "make things work."
