Learning has been a constant in my life ever since I first live booted Kali Linux on a USB stick sometime around 2013. I believe in continuous improvement and always adding to my toolbox.

While I've learned a broad variety of tools via the unique tech stacks in each of my positions, I pride myself on my ability to quickly acclimate to new stacks - rather than the particular tools in each stack.

Over the years, I've found some **tools that I absolutely cannot live without**:

*   Docker - 95%

*   Linux    - 95%

*   Python - 90%

*   Bash     - 90%

*   AWS      - 70%

**I am comfortable with the following languages:**

*   Python - 90%

*   Bash     - 90%

*   Java     - 80%

*   C++      - 70%

*   C# (gross!) - 60%
