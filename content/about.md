Learning has been a constant in my life ever since I first live booted Ubuntu on a USB stick. I believe in continuous improvement and always adding to my toolbox. Over the years, I've found some tools that I absolutely cannot live without:

*   Docker - 95%

*   Linux    - 95%

*   Python - 90%

*   Bash     - 90%

*   AWS      - 85%
