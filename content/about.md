Learning has been a constant in my life ever since I first live booted Kali Linux on a USB stick sometime around 2013. I believe in continuous improvement and always adding to my toolbox.

Over the years, I've found some **tools that I use in just about every project**:

*   Linux    - 100%

*   Docker   - 95%

*   Python - 90%

*   Bash     - 90%

**I am proficient with the following languages:**

*   Python - 90%

*   Bash     - 90%

*   Java     - 80%

**I am comfortable with the following languages:**

*   C++                     - 70%

*   JavaScript        - 60%

*   C# (gross!)        - 60%
